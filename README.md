# redapp
A Reddit app that works with a free personal Reddit API key, featuring comment summarization.


Inspired by the incredible work of the team at https://lo.cafe, particularly their fantastic app OpenArtemis,  set out to enhance this concept of an app that uses Redditâ€™s free personal API, aiming to add the functionality of comments summarization.

Just type the name of the subreddit (without the r/), select the nuber of posts to show ( maximum 100) and the if New, Hot, or Top and press load

This is the main view of the posts.Pressing the image will open same on a sperate view, swiping right to left open that post on the browser if you like to comment on it, swiping left ro right will whow more of the truncated text of the post

There you can find the Summarize comments button which will provide a compreensive summarization of the comments. The Summarize is verbose, it was designed this for my personal preference, if you wish for something short just go directly to the ask question part and enter a simple prompt like "give me a short summary of the comments"
Either pressing the summarize button first or going direcly to ther sk question, the adk function allows to engage in q&a abou the comments of that post.
The copy comments button, copies the comments to clipboard appeding a summarization prompt, for those cases in which you prefer to use another llm for the summariatio, that way just pasted on that other llm because the cvomments have been extracted with a summary prompt.

Since i wanted to maintain the comments visible while having the summary visiable at the same time, it was necessary to do some compromises on a small screen.
Drag this down to extend the summary/ask view to the preferable size

Just like on the previous function, now just press either summarize all comments  for a more verbose and detailed summary, or ask a question for q&a
